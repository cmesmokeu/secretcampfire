There was once a time when most websites on the Internet were owned by individual people. Since then, most publishing platforms have fallen into the grubby hands of big tech companies. 
And now, our freedom of speech is in danger.
Because once someone else controls your data, they can hold your data hostage, control what you say and strangle your voice; anytime what you say does not agree with their business agenda.

<p>
In 2019, <b>secret campfire</b> was created in response to this. It's purpose is to preserve free speech on the Internet. 

It is an immortal, lightweight, self-hosted microblogging system that...
<ul>
  <li>supports tumblr features like reblog, follow and an infinite-scroll dashboard feed
  <li>is built with 100% free (but industry-grade) services, so it costs you nothing to run your blog 24/7 forever
  <li>can never be killed, because you own and control: your blog, your blog's content &amp; your blog's social network
  <li>is open-source, so you may customize it to your heart's content
  <li>can run on any platform you like, so you are never locked into one service
</ul>
</p>

Share the love and protect your freedom:
